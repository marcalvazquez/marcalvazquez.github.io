### Education

* Inter-university Master of Science (2024 - Present)
* Inter-university Bachelor of Science in Bioinformatics (2021 - 2024)

### Experience
* Visiting Student Researcher at King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST) (2025 - Present)
    * Designed and conducted research on the role of linker histones as epigenetic regulators of hematopoiesis, supervised by Prof. David Gomez-Cabrero.
    * Applied Single-cell RNA Sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis and Differential Gene Expression (DGE) methods to investigate subtype-specific expression of H1 histones and their contribution to hematopoietic lineage specification.

* R&D Intern at HIPRA (2024 - 2025)
    * Designed and conducted research on drug discovery.
    * Applied bioinformatic analysis of nucleotide sequences, oligonucleotide and plasmid design, and transformation protocols to generate and characterize mutant strains. Performed phenotypic analyses of engineered strains to assess functional effects and support candidate drug validation.

* Research Intern at Institute of Evolutionary Biology (CSIC - Pompeu Fabra University) (2022 - 2024)
    * Designed and conducted research on comparative genomics and transcriptomics across diverse animal lineages, supervised by Dr. Rosa Fernández.
    * Applied large-scale bioinformatic pipelines, protein language models, and benchmarking of long-read transcriptome assembly strategies to investigate genome annotation quality, functional prediction of uncharacterized proteins, and isoform selection in non-model species.
    * Contributed to peer-reviewed publications including \textit{MATEdb2, a collection of high-quality metazoan proteomes across the Animal Tree of Life to speed up phylogenomic studies} and \textit{FANTASIA leverages language models to decode the functional dark proteome across the animal tree of life}.
